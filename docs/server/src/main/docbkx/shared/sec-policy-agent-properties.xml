 <title>About Policy Agent Properties</title>

 <indexterm>
  <primary>properties</primary>
 </indexterm>

 <para>Policy agent configuration properties can either be stored
  centrally in the OpenAM configuration store, or locally as a flat-file
  installed alongside the policy agent.</para>

 <para>Policy agent configuration settings are stored centrally by default
 in the OpenAM configuration store, which allows you to configure your policy
 agents on the OpenAM console for easier management and convenience. Any
 property change made in OpenAM using the console or the
 <command>ssoadm</command> command-line tool is immediately communicated to the
 agent by using a notification. Many policy agent properties are hot-swap
  enabled, allowing the change to take effect immediately without a server restart.
 </para>
 <para>Policy agent configuration settings can also be stored locally in a
  Java properties flatfile, such as
  <filename>Agent_001/config/${agentsConfigurationFile}</filename>,
  which is created when you install the agent.
  If you choose to use a local properties file, you must make all
  configuration changes by modifying property values in the
  <filename>${agentsConfigurationFile}</filename> file.
