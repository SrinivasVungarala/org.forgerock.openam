     <primary>disk storage requirements</primary>
     <secondary>server storage</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>
     Disk storage requirements for OpenAM servers depend
     partly on OpenAM itself and partly on your deployment. Disk storage
     requirements also depend on the
     space needed for binaries and configuration data,
     space for log files and rate of writes for logs,
     space for directory data and file system requirements
     when using an embedded OpenDJ directory server.
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
     <para>
      For initial installation, a few hundred MB is sufficient,
      not including the downloaded files.
     </para>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The OpenAM
       <literal>.war</literal>
       file size varies from release to release,
       but if your container holds one
       <literal>.war</literal>
       file
       and one directory with the contents of the
       <literal>.war</literal>
       file,
       the disk space required is on the order of 300 MB.
      </para>

      <para>
       This space requirement remains stable as you use OpenAM.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       The OpenAM configuration directory initially fits
       in approximately 50 MB of disk space
       including the embedded OpenDJ directory server.
      </para>

      <para>
       This space requirement grows as you use OpenAM.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
     By default, OpenAM servers write audit logs to flat files under
     <filename><replaceable>config-dir</replaceable>/openam/logs/
     </filename>.
     Alternatively, OpenAM servers can write audit logs to
     <filename>syslog</filename>, or to a relational database.
    </para>

    <para>
     When using flat-file audit logging,
     OpenAM lets you configure rotation and purging
     for logs under<filename>openam/logs/</filename>,
     so you can effectively cap the maximum disk space used for logs.
     Make sure, however, that you retain the information you need
     before logs are purged.
     Also make sure that your disk can keep pace with the volume of logging,
     which can be significant in high volume deployments,
     as OpenAM logs not only errors, but also access messages.
    </para>

    <para>
     For details about audit logging configuration, see the
     <citetitle>Administration Guide</citetitle>

    </para>

    <para>
     By default, OpenAM servers write debug logs to flat files under
     <filename><replaceable>config-dir</replaceable>/openam/debug/
     </filename>.
     OpenAM lets you configure rotation for debug logs.
     As you can change debug log levels at runtime when investigating issues,
     debug log volume is not as predictable as for regular logs.
     Leave a margin in production environments,
     so that you can turn up debug log levels to diagnose problems.
    </para>

    <para>
     For details about debug logging configuration, see the

     <para>
      When using the embedded OpenDJ directory server, take the following into
      account:
     </para>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       OpenDJ is designed to work with local storage for the database, but
       not for network file system (NFS) nor network-attached storage (NAS) due
       to some file system locking functions that OpenDJ needs.
       High performance storage, like solid state drives (SSD), is essential
       if you need to handle high write throughput.
      </para>

      <para>
       By default, OpenAM's configuration directory resides
       under the
       <literal>$HOME</literal>
       directory of the user running the container.
       <literal>$HOME</literal>
       directories can be mounted over the network.
      </para>

      <para>
       This is not an issue if you are using OpenDJ mainly for configuration
       data.
       It can however be a serious problem
       when you use OpenDJ to back the CTS
       in a high-volume deployment.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Embedded OpenDJ directory server log files are stored under
       <filename><replaceable>config-dir</replaceable>/opends/logs/
       </filename>.
       As for OpenAM, you can configure OpenDJ directory server
       log rotation and purging.
       The default cap for access logs is 2 GB.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>

       OpenAM stores policy information in the configuration directory.
       The space this takes up depends on the policies you have.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       By default, OpenAM stores CTS information in the configuration directory.
       The space this takes up depends on the volume of traffic to the server
       and whether OpenAM is configured for stateless sessions.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       With the default database implementation,
       OpenDJ database files handling sustained writes
       can grow to about double their initial size on disk.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       For OpenDJ on Linux systems,
       enable file system write barriers and ensure the file system
       journaling mode is ordered to avoid directory database file corruption
       after crashes or power failures.
       For details on enabling write barriers
       and setting the journaling mode for data,
       see the options for your file system
       in the
       <command>mount</command>
       command manual page.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       OpenDJ directory server uses file descriptors when handling connections.
      </para>

      <para>
       Defaults can be limited to 1024 file descriptors per user on Linux
       systems.
       Consider increasing this limit to at least 64K.

     <secondary>disk storage requirements</secondary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>
     Policy agents are implemented as libraries or Web applications,
     and so tend to be small on disk, not more than a few MB.
    </para>

    <para>
     You can configure policy agents to perform local logging to files,
     or to send log messages to OpenAM for remote logging.
     For details, see the
     <citetitle>Configuration Reference</citetitle>
     for your policy agent.
    </para>

    <para>
     Debug messages are logged to local files, however, not remotely.
     Debug logging volume depends on log level.
     As for OpenAM, leave a margin in production environments
     so that you can turn up debug log levels to diagnose problems.

    </indexterm>

    <para>
     The OpenIG Web application can vary in size from release to release.
     On disk, the
     <literal>.war</literal>
     file is under 50 MB.
     For containers that keep both the
     <literal>.war</literal>
     file and an unpacked version,
     the total size is under 100 MB.
    </para>

    <para>
     By default, OpenIG configuration resides
     under the
     <literal>$HOME</literal>
     directory of the user who runs the container.
    </para>

    <para>
     If you use the default log sink,
     messages are sent to the container logs.
     Manage those as you would any container logs.
    </para>

    <para>
     Capture logging and any logging you perform from scriptable filters and
     handlers
     can potentially generate significant write traffic.
     Furthermore, OpenIG does not run rotation or purging for such logs.
     You must manage any logs OpenIG generates
     using a
     <literal>CaptureFilter</literal>
     or log messages from scriptable
     filters and handlers.
    </para>

    <para>
     Both normal log messages and debug messages go to the log sink.
     As for other components, debug logging volume depends on log level.
     Leave a margin in production environments
     so that you can turn up debug log levels to diagnose problems.

      The following are based on the preceding information in this section.
      When deciding on disk storage, keep the following recommendations in mind:
     </para>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       Plan enough space and enough disk I/O
       to comfortably absorb the load for logs.
      </para>

      <para>
       Check your assumptions in testing.
       For example, make sure that logs are cleaned up
       so that they do not exceed your space threshold
       even in long-duration testing.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       For deployments where an embedded OpenDJ directory service
       handles high throughput,
       make sure you use a local file system
       and that the user running the container has enough file descriptors.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       When using local policy agent logs,
       make sure you have a mechanism in place to clean them up.
      </para>
     </listitem>

     <listitem>
      <para>
       For OpenIG, make sure you turn off
       <literal>CaptureFilter</literal>
       logging,
       scriptable filter, and handler debug logging
       before moving to production.

   <para>
    OpenAM core services require a minimum JVM heap size of 1 GB and, when
    running on JDK 7, a minimum permanent generation size of 256 MB. If you are
    including the embedded OpenDJ directory, OpenAM requires at least a 2 GB
    heap, as 50% of that space is allocated to OpenDJ.
   </para>

   <note>
    <para>
     Ensure that the <literal>Xms</literal> and <literal>Xmx</literal> JVM
     parameters are set to the same value to prevent a large garbage collection
     as the memory profile increases from the default up to the <literal>Xms</literal> value.
     Also, setting <literal>Xms</literal> and <literal>Xmx</literal> to the same value
     ensures that small controlled garbage collection events minimize
