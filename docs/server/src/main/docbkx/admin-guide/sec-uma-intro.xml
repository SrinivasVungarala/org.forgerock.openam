 <title>OpenAM and the UMA Workflow</title>

 <para>UMA defines a workflow for allowing resource owners to manage
 access to their protected resources by creating authorization policies on a
 centralized authorization server, such as OpenAM.</para>

 <para>The actions that form the UMA workflow are as follows:</para>

 <variablelist>
  <varlistentry>
  <term>1. Manage</term>
  <listitem>
   <para>The resource owner manages their resources on the resource server.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>2. Protect</term>
  <listitem>
   <para>The resource
    owner links their resource server and chosen authorization server,
    for example an OpenAM instance.</para>
   <para>The authorization server provides a protection API so that the resource
    server can register sets of resources. Use of the protection API requires a
    protection API token (PAT) - an OAuth 2.0 token with a specific scope.</para>
   <para>For more information, see <xref linkend="managing-uma-resource-sets" />.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>3. Control</term>
  <listitem>
   <para>The resource
    owner controls who has access to their registered resources by
    creating policies on the authorization server.</para>
   <para>For more information, see <xref linkend="sec-uma-policies" />.</para>
  </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>4. Authorize</term>
  <listitem>
   <para>The client, acting on behalf of the requesting party, uses the
    authorization server's authorization API to acquire a requesting party token
    (RPT). The requesting party or client may need further interaction with the
    authorization server at this point, for example to supply identity claims.
    Use of the authorization API requires an authorization API token (AAT) - an
    OAuth 2.0 token with a specific scope.</para>
   <para>For more information, see <xref linkend="accessing-uma-protected-resources" />.</para>
    </listitem>
  </varlistentry>
  <varlistentry>
   <term>5. Access</term>
  <listitem>
   <para>The client presents the RPT to the resource server, which verifies its
    validity with the authorization server and, if both valid and containing
    sufficient permissions, returns the protected resource to the requesting
    party.</para>
   <para>For more information, see <xref linkend="accessing-uma-protected-resources" />.</para>
