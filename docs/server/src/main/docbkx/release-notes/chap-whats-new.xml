    <para>
     <emphasis role="bold">Stateless Sessions</emphasis>.
     OpenAM ${serverDocTargetVersion} supports two types of sessions:
     <firstterm>stateful</firstterm> and <firstterm>stateless</firstterm>.
    </para>
    <para>
     Stateful sessions are sessions that reside in the OpenAM server's memory
     and, if session failover is enabled, are also persisted in the Core Token
     Service's token store. Stateful sessions have been the only session type
     supported in previous OpenAM releases.
    </para>
    <para>
     OpenAM ${serverDocTargetVersion} also supports a new type of
     session: the stateless session. Stateless sessions are sessions in which
     state information is encoded in OpenAM and sent to clients, but the
     information from the sessions is not retained in OpenAM's memory.
     For browser-based clients, OpenAM sets a cookie in the browser that
     contains the session state. When the browser transmits the cookie back to
     OpenAM, OpenAM decodes the session state from the cookie.
    </para>
    <para>
     Stateless sessions can be used for deployments when elasticity is required,
     for example, cloud deployments in which the server load varies. You can add
     and remove OpenAM servers to and from a site and the stateless session load
     should balance horizontally.

     These settings provide more control to select the exact authentication

    <para>
     To set the JVM properties, manually edit the <command>ssoadm</command> or
     <command>ssoadm.bat</command> script.

     The <literal>indexType</literal> property specifies

     To ensure that the serialized objects have not been
     exploited by a malicious user, OpenAM now provides a new
     <literal>openam.deserialisation.classes.whitelist</literal> property that
     lists valid classes when OpenAM performs object deserialization.
     The default should work for most deployments.
    </para>
    <para>
     You can access and update the property in the OpenAM console by navigating to
     Configuration &gt; Servers and Sites &gt; Default Server Settings &gt;
     Security &gt; Object Deserialisation Class Whitelist.
