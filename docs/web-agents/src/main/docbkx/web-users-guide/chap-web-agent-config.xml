  <title>Configuring Web Policy Agents</title>

  <indexterm>
   <primary>web policy agent</primary>
   <secondary>configuration</secondary>
  </indexterm>

 <!-- The following two paras are used in the admin guide, j2ee pa users and
 web pa users guides -->



 <para>
  You install policy agents in web servers and web application containers
  to enforce access policies OpenAM applies to protected web sites and web
  applications. Policy agents depend on OpenAM for all authentication and
  authorization decisions. Their primary responsibility consists in enforcing
  what OpenAM decides in a way that is unobtrusive to the user. In organizations
  with many servers, you might well install many policy agents.
 </para>

	<para>
  Policy agent configuration is distinct from policy configuration. The only
  policy-like configurations that you apply to policy agents are:
 	<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>
URLs to exclude from policy enforcement (<firstterm>not enforced
URLs</firstterm>)
 	   </para>
 	 	  </listitem>
 	 		  <listitem>
 	 		   <para>
 	 		    Client IP addresses to exclude from policy enforcement (<firstterm>not
 	 		    enforced IPs</firstterm>)
 	 		   </para>
 	 		  </listitem>
 	 		 </itemizedlist>
 	 		</para>

 	 		<section xml:id="web-agents-configuration-location">
 	 		 <title>Configuration Location</title>

 	 		 <para>
 	 		  Policy agent configuration properties are either stored:
 	 		  <itemizedlist>
 	 		   <listitem>
 	 		    <para>
 	 		     Centrally, in the OpenAM configuration store
 	 		    </para>
 	 		   </listitem>
<listitem>
 	 		    <para>
 	 		     Locally, as a flat file
 	 		    </para>
 	 		   </listitem>
 	 		  </itemizedlist>
 	 		 </para>

 	 		 <section xml:id="centrally-stored-configuration">

 	 		  <title>Centrally Stored Agent Configuration</title>

 	 		  <para>
 	 		   By default, policy agent configuration settings are stored centrally in the
 	 		   OpenAM configuration store. Storing the policy agent configuration centrally
 	 		   allows you to configure your policy agents by using the OpenAM console,
 	     	   the <command>ssoadm</command> command line tool, or the REST API for easier
 	 		   management. Any property change made in OpenAM is immediately communicated to
 	 		   the agent by using a notification. Many policy agent properties are hot-swap
 	 		   enabled, allowing the change to take effect immediately without restarting
 	 		   the policy agent.
 	 		  </para>

 	 		  <para>
 	 		   You configure policy agents in realms. To access the centralized web policy
 	 		   agent configuration, select Realms &gt; <replaceable>Realm Name</replaceable>
 	 		   &gt; Agents &gt; Web &gt; <replaceable>Agent Name</replaceable> in the OpenAM
 	 		   console.
 	 		  </para>
 	 		  <para>
 	 		   For more information on creating centrally-stored agent profiles,
 	 		   see <xref linkend="create-agent-profiles"/>.
 	 		  </para>
 	 		 </section>

 	 		 <section xml:id="locally-stored-configuration">

 	 		  <title>Locally Stored Agent Configuration</title>

 	 		  <para>
 	 		   The policy agent installer can create a flat file with the agent
 	 		   configuration. The file is named <filename>${agentsConfigurationFile}</filename>
 	 		   and is stored at the path
 	 		   <filename>/web_agents/<replaceable>agent_version</replaceable>instances/Agent_<replaceable>nnn</replaceable>/config</filename>.
 	 		  </para>
 	 		  <para>
 	 		   If you choose to use a locally-stored agent configuration, you make all
 	 		   configuration changes by modifying property values in the
 	 		   <filename>${agentsConfigurationFile}</filename> file. You cannot make changes
 	 		   using the OpenAM console, command-line interface, or REST API.
 	 		  </para>

 	 		  <para>
 	 		   When using a locally-stored agent configuration, provide valid
 	 		   values for configuration properties ending in the following strings:
 	 		  </para>

 	 		  <!-- Fix for OPENAM-724. -->
 	 		  <itemizedlist>
 	 		   <listitem><para><literal>.cookie.name</literal></para></listitem>
 	 		   <listitem><para><literal>.fqdn.default</literal></para></listitem>
 	 		   <listitem><para><literal>.agenturi.prefix</literal></para></listitem>
 	 		   <listitem><para><literal>.naming.url</literal></para></listitem>
 	 		   <listitem><para><literal>.login.url</literal></para></listitem>
 	 		   <listitem><para><literal>.instance.name</literal></para></listitem>
 	 		   <listitem><para><literal>.username</literal></para></listitem>
 	 		   <listitem><para><literal>.password</literal></para></listitem>
 	 		   <listitem><para><literal>.connection_timeout</literal></para></listitem>
 	 		   <listitem><para><literal>.policy_clock_skew</literal></para></listitem>
 	 		  </itemizedlist>

 	 		  <para>
 	 		   The web policy agent installer populates properties required to connect to an
 	 		   OpenAM instance. Additional properties are needed when settings are stored
 	 		   locally.
 	 		  </para>
